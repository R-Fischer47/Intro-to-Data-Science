# InvertedIndex
#
# Inverted index.  Keeps track of terms and the documents they occur in
# as well as count (posting lists).
#
# Uses a simple linked list data structure internally.  Not super efficient
# but good for experimentation.

class InvertedIndex:
  ##
  # Constructor
  #
  # No parameters required.  Simply creates an empty linked list and
  # documentID list for tracking of items posted to the index.
  #
  # The index itself is made up of the terms list described above.
  # Each terms list entry consists of an ordered pair.
  # term[i] = (a, b)
  #           a - Word indexed
  #           b - Linked list containing list data items
  #               Each data item is of the form (c, d)
  #               c - document identifier
  #               d - Term frequency of term a in document c.
  # The terms list is kept sorted on the term value
  #
  # The docs list is simply a list of the documentID's passed into
  # the InvertedIndex to be indexed.  This list is also kept sorted.
  # Useful for generating sorted output.
